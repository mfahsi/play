Recap of the 10 Stability Patterns:
Circuit Breaker: Prevents repeated execution of operations likely to fail to avoid cascading failures.
Bulkhead: Isolates system components to prevent failures in one part from affecting others.
Retry: Automatically retries failed operations with backoff strategies to handle transient failures.
Timeout: Limits the time allowed for an operation to complete to prevent indefinite waits and resource exhaustion.
Throttling: Controls the rate of requests to manage load and ensure system responsiveness.
Failover: Switches to backup components in case of failures to maintain service continuity.
Service Mesh: Manages service-to-service communication, enhancing reliability in microservices architectures.
Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across servers to prevent overload and improve system performance.
Health Check: Monitors and checks the health of system components to detect and recover from failures.
Idempotency: Ensures operations can be repeated without unintended side effects, enhancing resilience to failures.
